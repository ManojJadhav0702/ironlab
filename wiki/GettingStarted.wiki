#summary How to get started with IronLab.

= Requirements =
The !IronPython Console works either with Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010. Solution files for both of these exist.

To use !NumPy and !SciPy .NET with the console, Visual Studio 2010 is required (!IronPython 2.7; .NET 4.0 onwards).

The latest project code is not yet available as a set of binaries.

Direct3D and Direct2D acceleration require SlimDX, End User Runtime, available [http://slimdx.org/download.php here]. Other functionality should work fine without this.

= Build from source =
== Basic build ==
  # Download complete source code from Trunk.
  # Start Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 solution file and build all.
  # Set !IronPythonConsole as start-up project and run.
  # !PlotSample gives some examples of using the !IronPlot library from C# rather than from !IronPython.

== Adding !NumPy and !SciPy ==
The easiest way to get started is from an existing !IronPython installation that includes !NumPy and !SciPy, copying the required packages.
Copy your !IronPython 2.7 installation folders (including !NumPy and !SciPy)
*DLLs, Doc, Lib* into the build bin directory.
Copy ILabPythonLib\ironplot folder into the newly copied bin\Lib\site-packages.
Try:
<code language="py">
import numpy as np
import ironplot as ip
ip.plot(np.sin(np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)))
</code>
to check this is working. Then look at Examples\!NumpyPlot for more examples.
