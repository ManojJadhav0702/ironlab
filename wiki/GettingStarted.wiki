#summary How to get started with IronLab.

= Requirements =
The IronPython Console works either with Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010. Solution files for both of these exist.

To use NumPy and SciPy .NET with the console, Visual Studio 2010 is required (IronPython 2.7; .NET 4.0 onwards).

The latest project code is not yet available as a set of binaries.

Direct3D and Direct3D acceleration require SlimDX, End User Runtime available [http://slimdx.org/download.php here]. Other functionality should work fine without this.

= Build from source =
== Basic build ==
  # Download complete source code from Trunk
  # Start Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 solution file and build all.
  # Set IronPythonConsole as start-up project and run.
  # PlotSample gives some examples of using the IronPlot library from C# rather than from IronPython.

== Adding NumPy and SciPy ==
Copy your IronPython 2.7 installation folders (including NumPy and SciPy)
DLLs, Doc, Lib into the build bin directory.
copy ILabPythonLib\ironplot folder into the newly copied bin\Lib\site-packages
Try:
<code language="py">
import numpy as np
import ironplot as ip
ip.plot(np.sin(np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)))
<hello target="world"/>
</code>
